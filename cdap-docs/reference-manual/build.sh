# Build script for docs
# Builds the docs (all except javadocs and PDFs) from the .rst source files using Sphinx
# Builds the javadocs and copies them into place
# Zips everything up so it can be staged

# Target for building the SDK
# Targets for both a limited and complete set of javadocs
# Targets not included in usage are intended for internal usage by script
